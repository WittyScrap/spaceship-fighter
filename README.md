# Spaceship Fighter
### Previously: Uberverse

This game has been restored from an older backup; some work on it has been lost.
A thread about the game was made on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/eh8cck/wip_hyperspace_jump_effect/), showing off the warp-in/warp-out features, I will carry out more work on it during my spare time.

Planned features:

  - A realistic flight model;
  - Different enemy ship tiers;
  - Gameplay inspirations from FTL and EVERSPACE;
  - Weapon loadout changes restricted to during-warp;
  - More...
